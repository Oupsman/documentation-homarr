# Migrate from 0.15.10+ to 1.0.0

In this guide, we will show you how to migrate from Homarr 0.15.10+ to 1.0.0.
If you are still on a version before 0.15.10, please update to 0.15.10 where we introduced the migration export page.

## Export your data

As 1.0 is a complete rewrite of Homarr and therefor not compatible with the old docker mounts, we need to export your data first.
For this you can navigate to the `Migrate to 1.0` page which you can find under `Management` > `Tools` > `Migrate to 1.0`.
Here you can select which things you want to export and download the zip file.
It will also show you a secret key which you will need to import the secret data like user password hashes, salts and integration secrets.

## Create a parallel installation

We highly recommend to create a parallel installation of Homarr 1.0.0.
So if something with for example the import does not quite work, the data in the old installation is still available.
To do this you can follow the appropriate [installation guide](https://homarr.dev/docs/category/installation-1) for your system.
Please note that if you are using docker you need to specify a diffrent external port for the new installation as the old one had the same port.
So in your compose file the ports would be `7576:7575` instead of `7575:7575`.

## Import your data
Once the installation is completed you can access the new installation. During the onboarding you'll need to select `Import from Homarr before 1.0`.

After that you can upload the zip file you downloaded in the first step.

After that you'll get a list with all your boards that can be imported. You can configure how it should be imported and can select which screensizes it should import.

Once you have selected everything you can click on `Confirm import and continue` which will open the encryption key input dialog where you can input the secret key you got during the export.

After that you can continue the onboarding and you should see all your boards and data in the new installation.

See [After the installation](https://homarr.dev/docs/getting-started/after-the-installation) for more information.

## Remove the old installation

After you are happy with the new installation and everything is working as expected you can remove the old installation.
Please make sure to backup the data before you remove the old installation.
Also once the port 7575 is free again you can change the port mapping of the new installation to `7575:7575` if you want to.
